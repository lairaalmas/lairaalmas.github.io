infoBox_circleOne=<li>Flight themed, in this game the character is a child who wants to fly in a balloon to get to school.</li><li>This game represents a fraction like portion of a circle (arc). Thus, the selected arcs must be proportional to the path to be traversed.</li><li>The mathematical operations with fractions represented in this game are: addition (child going to the right) and subtraction (child going to the left), besides of both operations at the same level.</li>
infoBox_diff=Choose game difficulty. When <b>higher value</b>, <b>higher overall difficulty</b> of the levels in the level map.
infoBox_diff_aux=<b>About the level map:</b> Each game created generates 4 levels (illustrated as positions on a map) in ascending order of difficulty, based on that choice of difficulty.
infoBox_diff_obs=<i>Note: Difficulty 1 only uses integers.</i>
infoBox_misc_label=Choose whether or not the game should display fraction value.
infoBox_misc_rect=Choose whether or not the game should show auxiliary blocks.

infoBox_mode_c1_A=Select the balloon position.
infoBox_mode_c1_B=Select the arcs.
infoBox_mode_s1_A=Select a portion of the soil.
infoBox_mode_s1_B=Select a portion of the blocks.
infoBox_mode_s2_A=Largest number of subdivisions in top rectangle.
infoBox_mode_s2_B=Largest number of subdivisions in bottom rectangle.
infoBox_oper=Choose the math operation involving fractions to be covered in the current game. <i>Different games cover different operations.<i>
infoBox_squareOne=<li>With a rural theme, in this game the character is a tractor who wants to push a bunch of blocks in order to fill an open hole in the farm's grass.</li><li>This game represents a fraction as a portion of a rectangle. Thus, the blocks taken by the tractor must be equivalent to the hole in the ground.</li><li>The math operations with fractions represented in this game are: addition (tractor going right) and subtraction (tractor going left).</li>
infoBox_squareTwo=<li>In this game the character is a child who wants to walk to school.</li><li>This game represents a fraction like portion of a rectangle. Thus, two rectangles with different subdivisions are shown and the player must select equivalent portions.</li><li>The mathematical operation represented in this game is equality of fractions.</li>
